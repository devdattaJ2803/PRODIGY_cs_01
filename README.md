# Caesar Cipher Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a Caesar Cipher algorithm as part of my Cyber Security Internship. The project includes a Python script that creates a GUI application for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

## Contents

- `caesar_cipher_gui.py`: A Python script that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a GUI using `tkinter`.
- `README.md`: Documentation and details about the project.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption**: Allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
- **GUI Application**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is visually appealing and easy to use.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Execute the `caesar_cipher_gui.py` script to launch the GUI application:
     ```bash
     python caesar_cipher_gui.py
     ```

2. **Interact with the GUI**:
   - Enter your message in the input text area.
   - Specify the shift value.
   - Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to see the result in the output text area.

## Learning Outcomes

- Implemented the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python.
- Created a GUI application using `tkinter`.
- Practiced using Git and GitHub for version control and project management.
